# P12: isoFLOP profile. Every arm gets the SAME training compute.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The compute-optimal ladder sets each arm's token budget from its own
#   parameter count (10.5 x (matrices + lm_head)). That is a defensible
#   protocol but it is a protocol, and it is the one a reviewer will question,
#   because MST draws 1.43x the tokens of the dense model matched to it on
#   active FLOPs (see p11_active_params.py). An isoFLOP profile removes the
#   question entirely: fix C, vary model size, plot final bpb against C. This
#   is Chinchilla's "approach 2" and the default convention in efficiency work.
#
#   Read it as: at a fixed training-compute budget, which architecture's
#   best-performing model is better, and how big is that model?
#
# THE BUDGET
#   C = 6.710562e17 active FLOPs. That is MST L=16's existing training budget to six
#   figures (10.5 x 111,235,072 scaling params x 5.7455e8 active FLOPs/token), so that
#   run is already a point on the profile and costs nothing to reuse. Six new runs at
#   6.71e17 each is 4.0e18 total, about 0.8x of one L=24 run. isoFLOP cost does not
#   depend on which depths you pick, only on how many.
#
#   A second contour at C=4.8e18 (L=24's budget) would reuse MST L=24 the same
#   way, but costs ~6x an L=24 run. Only worth it if this one is favourable.
#
# ACTIVE, NOT TOTAL
#   --target-active-flops, not --target-flops. base_train's --target-flops
#   divides by estimate_flops()[0], the TOTAL count, while the Pareto plots use
#   [1], the active one. For MST those differ by 1.34x at L=24, so using the
#   total would put MST on a tighter contour than dense and bias the profile
#   against it without anyone noticing.
#
# EXPECTED SHAPE OF THE ANSWER
#   MST's training-FLOPs multiplier on the ladder is 1.08-1.14x, and the bpb
#   gap on that axis is 0.003-0.005, so a small separation is the honest
#   prediction. State that before looking. This profile is for credibility,
#   not for a big number; if you want the big number it is on the inference
#   axis and p13_isodata.sh is the run that gets it.

# C is pinned by two constraints that leave almost no freedom.
#
# 1. STRADDLING. A depth set brackets its optimum when C falls between the own-budgets of
#    its 2nd and 3rd points. That gives MST 24/28/32/36 the window [7.69e18, 1.56e19] and
#    dense 18/20/22/24 the window [1.29e19, 2.21e19]; the overlap is [1.29e19, 1.56e19]
#    and 1.42e19 is its geometric centre. Outside that window one arm sits entirely on one
#    side of its parabola and its vertex becomes an extrapolation.
#
# 2. THE CORPUS. One shard holds ~252.8M characters, so MAX_SHARDS=300 is roughly 18B
#    tokens and the protocol is single-epoch. The cheapest-per-token arm fixes the ceiling:
#    at 1.42e19 the binding arm is MST L=24 at 9.6B tokens, 0.53 epochs, comfortable.
#    (The previous 9.0e18 was capped by MST L=16 at 0.87 epochs. Dropping L=16 is what
#    made a larger budget possible at all: it lifted the MST ceiling from 1.03e19 to
#    2.68e19.)
#
# own budget / C at 1.42e19:
#   dense  L=18 0.51x  L=20 0.91x  L=22 1.56x  L=24 2.53x   (702M .. 1.38B params)
#   MST    L=24 0.25x  L=28 0.54x  L=32 1.10x  L=36 2.08x   (879M .. 2.09B params)
# Both straddle, dense between L=20 and L=22, MST between L=28 and L=32.
# Cost: 8 arms x 1.42e19 = 1.14e20. Run --timer-only before committing.

# L=18,22,26,30,34 do NOT and have no MST arm at all.
#
# L=16 is dropped: it is the cheapest-per-token MST arm and capped the whole profile at
# C=1.03e19, and at 1.42e19 it would need 24.7B tokens, past a single epoch of the corpus.
# L=20 stays excluded as MST's known off-trend ladder point.
#
# ALIGNMENT. sub_dim is a multiple of 128 only at L=8,16,24,32,40; L=28 (448) and L=36
# (576) are 64 mod 128 and miss tensor-core alignment, which cost L=28 an off-trend MFU of
# 18.7% against 21.7% at the smaller L=24. There is no four-point aligned set in this
# range: 24/32/40 is aligned but L=40's own budget is 5.3e19, far outside any affordable C,
# and 16/24/32/40 reintroduces the corpus cap. So two of four MST points are misaligned by
# necessity. Check their residuals before trusting the fitted vertex, and if either lands
# off the curve, fit 24/32 plus whichever of 28/36 is clean.
#
# Note the shared-FFN headline does NOT remove this: the shared FFN is only 16% of MST's
# matrix parameters at L=32, and the other 84% (attention qkv, output projection, the
# transition) is still block-diagonal at K = sub_dim.
