# P13: iso-data profile. Every arm sees the SAME tokens, and the baseline is a
# ladder rather than a single point, so a multiplier can be read off directly.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE ONE TO RUN FIRST
#   MST's claim is an inference-cost claim: better quality per FLOP spent at
#   serving time. That is the MoE convention (Mixtral reports 12.9B active of
#   46.7B total), and the standard way to support it is to fix the training
#   data, then compare quality against inference cost.
#
#   Fixing the data removes the objection the compute-optimal ladder invites.
#   Under the ladder's rule MST draws 1.43x the tokens of the dense model
#   matched to it on active FLOPs (p11_active_params.py). Here nobody draws
#   more than anyone else, so the resulting multiplier needs no protocol
#   defence at all.
#
# WHY A DENSE LADDER AND NOT A SINGLE DENSE POINT
#   One dense run at D tokens gives a comparison, not a multiplier: dense L=16
#   will simply beat MST L=16 on bpb while costing 2.76x the FLOPs per token,
#   and neither number alone is the claim. To say "MST reaches this bpb at
#   Nx fewer FLOPs" you need the dense bpb-versus-FLOPs curve AT THIS TOKEN
#   COUNT, which means several dense depths. That is the real price of an
#   unimpeachable comparison and there is no way around it.
#
# THE BUDGET
#   D = 1,167,968,256 tokens, MST L=16's own compute-optimal budget EXACTLY
#   (10.5 x 111,235,072 scaling params), so that run is already a point and costs
#   nothing to reuse. The exact figure matters: total_batch_size is auto-computed from
#   target_tokens and snapped to a power of two, so a rounded budget can land on a
#   different batch size and stop being the same run.
#
#   Cost: dense L=10/12/14/16 at this D is 0.56+0.86+1.29+1.81 = 4.5e18, plus MST L=12
#   and L=24 at 0.37e18 and 1.73e18. About 6.6e18 total, roughly 1.4x one L=24 run.
#
# STATE THE PREDICTION BEFORE LOOKING
#   At L=8 iso-token, MST read 1.061x against dense's 1.000x. On its own budget
#   at L=16 it reads 1.222x. The truth is somewhere between and it is NOT the
#   2.4x FLOPs ratio between the two architectures at equal depth: at that
#   ratio MST is a worse model. Expect roughly 1.1-1.2x.
